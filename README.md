# Terrible-Ideas

"Self explanatory. Most are in Python and are therefore politically correct in that they do not discriminate by platform"

Have you ever had an idea for a program that served no other purpose other than its own existence? We do, often. In an attempt to somehow improve the lives of others, we created this repository where all the terrible ideas people could ever create could live in peace. Feel free to add whatever you would like to this, we will accept pretty much any pull request.

### Current List of Ideas (In correct order)
- Best Map (Python) : Maps of Maps of Maps of Maps!
- Monty Hall (Python) : Fill your buffer with booleans!
- Fork Bomb (various) : Creates unlimited copies of itself!
